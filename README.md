Presentation of my microprocessor project using digital. <br>
This project uses a program called Digital which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/hneemann/Digital">here</a> <br>
This microprocessor is able to perform basic functions:<br>
Arithmetic   - Addition & Subtraction<br>
Logic        - AND & OR<br>
Data Storing - Reading data to memory, Reading data from memory<br>
<br>
To start the program you must enter the "microprocessor.dig" file from digital<br>
From digital you are able to enter data into data in<br>
From the files you are able to change memory values and view opcodes in ram_vals.txt and rom_vals.txt respectively<br>
